# IRIS-BOT

A discord bot inspired by [IRIS](https://choices-stories-you-play.fandom.com/wiki/IRIS) from Endless Summer. While she can't really activate directive 1908 (because no Rourke), she is supposed to help you get all the assets and scripts and do more fun stuff (supposed to because she is still a work in progress)

Feel free to create an issue and help me develop this bot with any crazy ideas that you may have.

Note: This bot is a personal project and is not related to Pixelberry Studios in any way.


## Technical Info

- Developed using discord.py on python
- Uses protoc to decode scripts
